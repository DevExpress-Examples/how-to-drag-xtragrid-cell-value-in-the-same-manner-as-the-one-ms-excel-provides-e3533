# How to drag XtraGrid cell value in the same manner as the one MS Excel provides


<p>This example demonstrates how to provide the capability to drag and drop cell values in the same manner as the one MS Excel provides. In this example, when mouse cursor is above the selected cell bottom edge, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/system.windows.forms.cursors.sizeall(v=VS.80).aspx"><u>Cursors.SizeAll</u></a> is shown instead of the default cursor. At this moment you can drag the cell value to another cell. After the dropping, source cell value will be copied to the current cell, and source cell value will be cleared. </p><p><strong>See also</strong><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2621">How to copy a cell's value to other cells by dragging its right bottom edge</a><strong><br />
